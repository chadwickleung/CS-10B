 Assignment 10
 
 This program plays rhe game of life. This game is a computer simulation of the
 life and death events in a population of single-cell organisms. Each position in
 a two dimensional array can support one cell. The program will determine whether
 each position will be able to support life in the next generation

/*
 This function would simulate the evolve process of the cells in the array.
 It has the following rules:
 1. If the cell is currently empty:
    1. If the cell has exactly three living neighbors, it will come to life in the
    next generation.
    2. If the cell has any other number of living neighbors, it will remain empty.
 2. If the cell is currently living:
    1. If the cell has one or zero living neighbors, it will die of loneliness in
       the next generation.
    2. If the cell has four or more living neighbors, it will die of overcrowding
       in the next generation.
    3. If the cell has two or three neighbors, it will remain living.
 3. All births and deaths occur simultaneously. This point is critical to the correct result.
 
 pre : The array was set and each element in it has a bool value
 post: A new array that uses pointer to determine whether each element would have a
 true or false value.
