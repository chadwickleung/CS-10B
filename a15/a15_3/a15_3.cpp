 This program would use recursion to sort an array of integers into ascending order
 using the following idea: the function will place the smallest element in the first
 position, then sort the rest of the array by a recursive call.
 
 It has two auxiliary functions, swap and indexofSmaller to help me find the smallest
 item in the array and swap it with the first position in the function
